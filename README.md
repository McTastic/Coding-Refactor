# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Changed HTML to meet accesibility standards and moved the lighthouse score up to a 95 using alt tags on all images. 

Also went through the CSS and removed several redundant selectors and added ones that covered multiple things on the page when possible. Screenshot below shows the live application. 


## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
