# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Changed HTML to meet accesibility standards and moved the lighthouse score up to a 95 using alt tags on all images. 

Also went through the CSS and removed several redundant selectors and added ones that covered multiple things on the page when possible. Screenshot below shows the live application.
